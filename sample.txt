Pushing Our Life-Support System to Its Limits
Over the last 200 years, humans have radically altered the climate by burning fossil fuels and increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which has caused the planet to warm. The effects of increased heat and carbon emissions are pushing the ocean to its limits.

The ocean has protected us from the worst consequences of climate change, but at a cost to itself: the ocean absorbs about 31 percent of our carbon emissions each year, and it has taken in about 90 percent of the heat caused by global warming over the last 50 years. Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the water are causing the oceans to become more acidic. This makes it harder for some species to form their shells, from lobsters and crabs to the small “sea butterflies” that form an important link in Arctic marine food webs. Rising ocean temperatures are causing a variety of problems, including loss of sea ice, more frequent, intense storms, and marine heat waves that can kill off millions of animals.
